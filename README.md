Addressing the issues in supervised learning,that is lack more labeled data

Proposed a label prediction model that predicts labels to increase the size of training set using supervised ensemble learning. In modern days it is very difficult to fetch labels in larger quantity for the data as it is cost affective and additional costs are imposed for conducting large number of surveys, so there is a need to develop a system that predicts labels using limited amount of labeled data. We solve this problem by proposing an algorithm that learns from the existing labeled data and predict the labels for the large amount of unlabeled data samples. We employ a sampling network that samples the available labeled data and convert into chunks of training and testing datasets in the ratio of 1: n, where the value of n is decided based on the length of the labeled instances and further samples the training and testing datasets with the sampling coefficients given as an input to the system. We train the network by calculating Euclidean distance between the internal sampled chunks of both training and testing datasets in a mesh network and give the label which is winner of both internal and external voting process. Number of iterations and the sampling coefficients for this iterative learning will be provided as and input. Stopping criteria for the system to learn is provided as an input and if the accuracy of prediction is greater than the provided threshold, the system stops learning and store the best predictors and further use these best predictors to predict the actual large unlabeled data.
